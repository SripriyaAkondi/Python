# Python
A program has been written in python that allows users to play the TossUp game.

Toss up is a dice game that consists of 10 colored dice. Each die has one red side, two yellow sides, and three green sides. A player gets points for each die that lands on green. The players to continue to play additional games of “Toss Up!” until they choose to quit. The goal is the player with the highest score over 100 wins the game. The game also has some additional rules which includes:

1.	If you roll any greens, set them aside. You may take your score (one point for each green) and end your turn, or you may keep rolling the remaining Dice.
2.	If on any roll (this could be your first roll or you could be rolling remaining Dice), you don’t roll any greens and get one or more reds, you have just “run a red light” and you must immediately end your turn and score no points for this turn.
3.	If you roll all yellows, nothing happens, as these are just “caution lights,” and you can either roll again or end your turn and take your points.
